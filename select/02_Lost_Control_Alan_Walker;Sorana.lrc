[00:07.33] Hmm, yea
[00:11.03] Mirrors they never lie
[00:13.64] Don't see myself inside
[00:16.08] Why can't I get it right?
[00:18.16] I don't know
[00:21.19] You're always watching me fall
[00:23.48] Shadows they like my wall
[00:26.13] Why do I feel so small?
[00:28.46] I don't know
[00:34.46] 
[00:31.20] So I walk into the dead of night
[00:34.17] Where my monsters like to hide
[00:37.18] Chaos feels so good inside
[00:39.12] Now I know
[00:44.12] 
[00:41.97] I've lost, I've lost
[00:44.10] I've lost control again
[00:47.05] Always do the same and I'm to blame
[00:50.04] I've lost control again
[00:52.75] I don't, I don't
[00:55.07] I don't know who I am
[00:57.77] Always do the same and I'm to blame
[01:00.14] I've lost control again
[01:11.64] 
[01:23.97] Tired of being afraid
[01:26.67] But lately, I lost my faith
[01:29.58] What is love without pain
[01:31.73] It ain't home
[01:34.63] You're watching me but I'm below
[01:36.88] When I get caught I hope
[01:39.66] It's the kind of blackout that will
[01:41.92] Take me home
[01:47.92] 
[01:44.77] So I walk into the dead of night
[01:47.62] Where my monsters like to hide
[01:49.96] Chaos feels so good inside
[01:52.70] Now I know
[01:57.70] 
[01:55.07] I've lost, I've lost
[01:57.73] I've lost control again
[02:00.16] Always do the same and I'm to blame
[02:02.96] I've lost control again
[02:05.11] I don't, I don't
[02:07.99] I don't know who I am
[02:10.13] Always do the same and I'm to blame
[02:13.12] I've lost control again
[02:24.62] 
[02:36.37] I know that I'm a mess
[02:38.92] But I ain't trying to be the best
[02:41.63] So, whatever's coming next
[02:44.04] I better pray
[02:46.83] Never said I was an angel
[02:49.19] I am damaged all the way
[02:51.99] So whatever's coming next
[02:54.29] I better pray
[03:00.79] 
[02:57.16] I've lost, I've lost
[03:00.16] I've lost control again
[03:02.33] Always do the same and I'm to blame
[03:05.14] I've lost control again
[03:08.04] I don't, I don't
[03:10.22] I don't know who I am
[03:13.07] Always do the same and I'm to blame
[03:15.98] I've lost control again
